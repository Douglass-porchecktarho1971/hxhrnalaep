Man, I just...just walked out of Kesari Chapter 2 and wow, like, my brain's still buzzing. It's like the theater was louder than an overfilled espresso machine with all the sounds of battle and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre hammering around. What even was that? Ayushmann Khurrana was, uh, intense and I still got popcorn in my teeth, I should’ve stuck to jelly beans.

> I think there's this one scene where the ground opens up like some sort of nightmare flower, history bleeding through film. How did they make the air feel so tight, like I couldn’t breathe when soldiers held the gates? And then there’s this one kid who runs, and it...it reminded me of a squirrel I saw running headfirst into traffic. Back aching from those old theater seats. Not great. But man, you could almost hear the echoes of the past in there, like they just reached out of the screen and smacked you upside the head. Remember, gotta download the movie because damn, was I even there?

Some parts felt slow, like waiting for a kettle to boil, the sorrow stretching out like an eternity. Random thought, did they use actual bags of sand when everything exploded or was it CG? It didn’t taste digital. But it was harsh and real, like stale whiskey.

Then there was this sorta-dizzy moment, could’ve been just the noise, like when you chew on ice too fast and freeze your brain for a sec. Colors went wild in places and I swear the sound was too low at points—never thought I’d see history wrapped around someone’s neck like a scarf tryna choke em.

Watch the movie if you wanna feel like history itself just sucker-punched you in the gut. But also maybe make a stomach of steel, cause some of those scenes just stick to your insides. Aw man, I just stepped on some sticky floor popcorn.

Download the movie though, don’t let my recounting through noise and mess be the whole thing. Immerse yourself in all that reflective chaos.
